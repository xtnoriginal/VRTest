#Implementation

In our code, we customized the script to follow the drone while the drone navigation script was acquired in the package. We used pre-built city environments however we edited it by  adding our own city park in the middle of the  city  where the user interacts with the environment. For our tablet, we acquired a model asset store called Sci-Fi Tablet Computer. Created a material that we added to the screen and attached to the camera  for visualizations in third-person view. This was done to prevent simulator sickness.
